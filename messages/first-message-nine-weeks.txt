Hi [PARENT_NAME],

My name is Mr. Wang, and I am [STUDENT_NAME]'s Computer Science teacher.

[STUDENT_NAME] currently has a [GRADE_AVERAGE] (as of 8:00 AM this morning) and is in danger of failing for the nine weeks.
I have spoken with them about strategies to get things turned in to bring their grade up.
Could you check in with [STUDENT_NAME] and help with getting them back on track?

Please let me know if you have received this message, and if you would like a list of assignments they could work on, please let me know.

Looking forward to hearing from you and working with you to help [STUDENT_NAME] succeed!

Best,
Charles Wang
